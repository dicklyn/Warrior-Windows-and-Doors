<section id="installation">
  <h2>Our Proven Installation Process</h2>
  <p>When it comes to replacing windows and doors, the process matters as much as the product. At Warrior Windows & Doors, we have developed a structured yet flexible process that ensures every customer feels supported and satisfied from the very beginning. Unlike rushed installations, we emphasize clear planning, precision measurements, and communication at every step. Our mission is to make <a href="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/">window replacement</a> in Casa Grande not just effective but stress-free.</p>
  <h3>Step 1: Consultation and Inspection</h3>
  <p>Our journey begins with listening. We visit your home, examine your current windows and doors, and take time to understand your priorities. Some homeowners seek better insulation, others want modern designs, and many need safety upgrades. This stage is all about creating a clear picture of what success looks like for you.</p>
  <h3>Step 2: Options and Planning</h3>
  <p>After inspection, we provide tailored recommendations. You’ll see a selection of styles, materials, and finishes chosen specifically for your space. A detailed proposal follows, explaining every cost and timeline in plain language. We want you to feel confident, informed, and never pressured.</p>
  <h3>Step 3: Expert Installation</h3>
  <p>On installation day, we arrive on schedule and prepare your home carefully. We use protective coverings, check each measurement twice, and install every unit with precision. From the tight sealing of windows to the perfect alignment of doors, our team works with care and respect for your space.</p>
  <h3>Step 4: Walkthrough and Support</h3>
  <p>We don’t just finish and leave. Before completing the project, we walk you through every installation, answer questions, and show you how to care for your new products. We also provide long-term warranties to ensure your investment is secure for years to come.</p>

  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <img src="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sliding-Window.jpg" alt="Sliding Windows">
      <h3>Sliding Windows</h3>
      <p>Sliding windows are known for their simplicity and ease of use. They glide horizontally on tracks, making them perfect for wide walls where airflow and sunlight are priorities. Their modern, streamlined appearance makes them ideal for contemporary homes while remaining budget-friendly and durable.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Natural-light-and-air-flow.jpeg" alt="Awning Windows">
      <h3>Awning Windows</h3>
      <p>Hinged at the top, awning windows open outward to allow airflow even during light rain. They are excellent in kitchens and bathrooms, where ventilation is key. Their tight seal also makes them energy-efficient, providing both comfort and savings.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Expert-Window-Installation.jpg" alt="Casement Windows">
      <h3>Casement Windows</h3>
      <p>Casement windows swing outward like a door, operated by a crank. This design allows full top-to-bottom ventilation, unobstructed views, and one of the tightest seals against air leakage. Homeowners appreciate their energy performance and modern elegance.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Picture-Windows.jpg" alt="Picture Windows">
      <h3>Picture Windows</h3>
      <p>Picture windows don’t open, but they offer the best way to showcase outdoor views. Ideal for living rooms and lounges, they bring in maximum sunlight while serving as a design feature that adds spaciousness and style to interiors.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bay-Windows-scaled.jpg" alt="Bay Windows">
      <h3>Bay Windows</h3>
      <p>Bay windows extend outward from your wall, creating a cozy nook inside. Often designed with three panels, they add depth, natural light, and a classic architectural look. Many homeowners use the extra space as a reading corner or seating area.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Egress-windows-2-scaled.jpg" alt="Egress Windows">
      <h3>Egress Windows</h3>
      <p>Egress windows are safety essentials in basements and bedrooms. They meet building codes by providing a safe emergency exit. Beyond safety, they allow natural light and ventilation in areas that often feel dark or closed-off.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Professionally.jpg" alt="Garden Windows">
      <h3>Garden Windows</h3>
      <p>Garden windows are like mini greenhouses, projecting outward to capture sunlight. Perfect for kitchens, they are excellent for growing herbs, plants, or displaying decorations. They add charm while improving indoor brightness.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="https://warriorwindowsinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Expert-Choice.jpg" alt="Single & Double Hung Windows">
